    <!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <section role="region" class="photo-about">

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Just before I set off eight years ago on my around-the-world trip, I was working at a news organization in Prague, Czech Republic. My colleagues were from countries throughout the former Soviet Union. Unfortunately, news from these locations was often negative, suggesting that these places were somehow “bad” or implicitly dangerous.</p>
        <p><em>But my colleagues insisted, “You must see for yourself.”</em></p>
        <p>So, I did. I spent five months traveling through the Eastern Europe and Central Asia. An over-arching theme of my journey — and my lives — began to take shape: to share stories of people and places that usually don’t have a voice, with the aim of humanizing faraway places that people might otherwise never hear about or actively disregard. Why? Because stories connect people like no other mechanism. This connection helps dispel stereotypes and fears, and slowly replaces them with curiosity. It shifts the prevailing narrative, displacing the “one story” with the actual story of many — the story of humanity.</p>
        <p>I continued to travel in this vein, throughout Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, South America, and the Middle East and Africa. My experience, I found, was a function of how much I opened myself up to others, pushing the boundaries of what was comfortable. As I traveled with respect and an eye to the lives of local people and the beauty of local scenery, doors opened up to me that enriched my experiences and the experiences of the people with whom I interacted. This enabled me to tell richer stories, which in turn allowed me to give back to the places I traveled to by helping others understand them in a different light.</p>
